# Game of War

Welcome to the Game of War! This simple card game was created after experimenting with APIs and using the Fetch API to retrieve data. It's designed to be a fun and interactive way to enjoy a classic card game.

## Features

- **Deck of Card API:** We use the Deck of Card API to provide you with a deck of cards. The API allows us to shuffle and draw cards randomly, adding an element of unpredictability to the game.

- **Responsive Design:** The game is fully responsive, so you can enjoy it on both desktop and mobile devices. Play it on the go or from the comfort of your home!

## How to Play

1. **Start a New Game:** Click the "New Deck" button to begin a new round of the Game of War.

2. **Draw Cards:** Click the "Draw Cards" button to draw cards from the deck. Each player (you and the computer) will receive a card, and the player with the higher-ranking card wins the round.

3. **Winning and Losing:** If you win a round, you gain a point. If the computer wins a round, it gains a point. Keep playing rounds until one player reaches a specified number of points or until you decide to end the game.

4. **Enjoy:** Have fun playing the Game of War and see if you can beat the computer!
